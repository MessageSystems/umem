Portable libumem.
================

This is a port of Solaris libumem to non-Solaris systems.

The port was made while integrating libumem with our Momentum product,
and since it is a threaded application, we force the library into
threaded mode.

While the library is itself stable (it's the memory allocator used by the
Solaris OS), the port may have a few rough edges.  We're shipping umem with
Linux and Windows versions of our product as we have found it to be stable.

Note: Windows does not have build bits in this repo (we use a different system
for our product build), but it should build pretty easily if you assemble
a project file for your Windows compiler.

We will continue to update this project as and when we make improvements, and
welcome third-party patches that improve the usability for everyone.
